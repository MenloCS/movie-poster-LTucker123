# Movie Poster Project

You will design a movie poster step by step, using AI as a creative tool—not a shortcut.  
At each step, save and commit your work in GitHub Desktop.

## Using GitHub Desktop (Mac)

1. **Edit** this file (`movie-poster-project.md`) in TextEdit.  
2. **Save** your changes.  
3. Open **GitHub Desktop**.  
   - Check that `movie-poster-project.md` shows up under **Changes**.  
   - Write a commit summary (see below).  
   - Click **Commit to main**.  
4. Click **Push origin** (top bar) to upload to GitHub.com.  

**Commit Messages for Each Step**
- Step 1: *Completed creative brief*

# Movie Poster Steps

## Step 1: Creative Brief
*(Commit message: "Completed creative brief")*

Before you open any AI tools, plan your vision. This is your anchor—return to it after every AI generation.

**Your Movie Choice:**  
- **Movie Title:**  The Hunger Games
- **Why I chose this movie:**  I like the movie

**Core Emotion:**  
What ONE feeling should a viewer get from your poster? (Examples: wonder, fear, joy, excitement, mystery, tension, nostalgia)  
- **Core emotion:**  Courage, fear

**Essential Visual Element:**  
What ONE image, object, or visual MUST appear on your poster?  
- **Essential element:**  Mockingbird
- **Why this element:**  Very important symbol in the movie

**What NOT to Include:**  
What do you definitely NOT want? (This helps you evaluate AI outputs critically.)  
- **Avoid:**  No faces

**Color Palette:**  
- **Dominant color(s):**  Black
- **Accent color(s):**  Red
- **Overall mood:** (warm/cool/muted/vibrant/dark/bright)  Muted

**Composition:**  
- [ ] Close-up (face/detail)  
- [ ] Wide shot (landscape/setting)  
- [x] Medium shot (full figure)  
- [ ] Object/symbol centered  
- [ ] Character collage  

- **Focal point description:**  Centered on a person

## Step 2: AI Generation – First Attempts
*(Commit message: "Documented first two AI attempts")*

Open Adobe Firefly. Generate images based on your creative brief, but remember: you're exploring possibilities, not looking for a final answer.

**Attempt 1:**  
- **My prompt:**  Make a movie poster for the Hunger Games movie evoking feelings of courage and fear. Add a mockingbird and avoid adding faces. Make the dominant color black and the accent color red with an overall muted mood. Make it a Medium shot (full figure)  with the focal point centered on a person(Katniss)

- **What worked:**  Had Katniss in the middle and had a mockingbird
- **What didn't work:**  Mockingbird was on top of Katniss, and the background was weird, showing the face
- **What I'll change for next attempt:**  Be more specific about the mockingbird and background, and repeat not showing the face

**Attempt 2:**  
- **My prompt:**  Make a movie poster for the Hunger Games movie evoking feelings of courage and fear. Add a mockingbird in the background and avoid adding faces. Make the dominant color black and the accent color red with an overall muted mood. Make it a Medium shot (full figure)  with the focal point centered on a person (Katniss). Make the background the arena.

- **What worked:**  Mockingbird now in the background
- **What didn't work:**  Mokcingbird still centered in the background, still sees face, background still weird
- **What I'll change for next attempt:**  Be more specific and put mockingbird on the side, restate, don't add faces, say the background should be the cornucopia

## Step 3: AI Generation – Continued Iteration
*(Commit message: "Documented final AI attempts")*

Keep refining. Try at least two more meaningfully different directions.

**Attempt 3:**  
- **My prompt:**  Make a movie poster for the Hunger Games movie evoking feelings of courage and fear. Add a mockingbird in the background on the side, and don't add faces (make the person facing the back or side). Make the dominant color black and the accent color red with an overall muted mood. Make it a Medium shot (full figure)  with the focal point centered on a person (Katniss). Make the background the arena with the cornucopia

- **What worked:**  Mockingbird on the side
- **What didn't work:**  Weird symbol still, still see the face, cornucopia isn't an actual cornucopia
- **What I'll change for next attempt:**  Say it's the gold symbol, try again to say person standing backwards, clarify about cornucopia.

**Attempt 4:**  
- **My prompt:**  Make a movie poster for the Hunger Games movie evoking feelings of courage and fear. Add a mockingbird symbol from the movie on her clothes, and have Katniss facing backwards so we only see her back and not her face. Use an overall muted mood with darker colors. Make it a Medium shot (full figure)  with the focal point centered on a person (Katniss). Make the background the arena from the movie

- **What worked:**  Everything looked a lot better, facing back, mockbird on clothes, coloring looks better, background looks better
- **What didn't work:**  Background still a little strange, but much better

**Final AI Image Selected:** (Which attempt? Why?)  4 because it followed the instructions the best

## Step 4: Photoshop Modifications
*(Commit message: "Added Photoshop modifications")*

Export your best AI generation and open it in Photoshop. You must make at least TWO intentional modifications. The AI gave you raw material—now make it yours.

**Modification Ideas:**
- Crop or reframe the image  
- Adjust colors, contrast, or brightness  
- Add the movie title (typography matters!)  
- Add a tagline  
- Combine elements from multiple AI generations  
- Remove unwanted elements  

**Your Modifications:**  
1. Adjusted brightness
2.  Cropped
3. (optional)  

**Save your final poster as:** `final-poster.jpg` or `final-poster.png`  
**Drag your final poster file into your GitHub repo folder before committing.**

## Step 5: Reflection
*(Commit message: "Completed reflection")*

**How did your vision evolve?**  
Compare your original creative brief to your final poster. What changed? What stayed the same?  Most of it changed, person still there


**What decision are you most proud of that the AI didn't make for you?**  Mockingbird and person


**What would you do differently next time?**  Changed background more
